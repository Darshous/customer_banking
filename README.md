# Python-Challenge-2: Customer Banking System

## Description

The Customer Banking System is a Python-based application designed to manage Savings and Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts. The program allows users to input initial balances, interest rates, and durations to calculate the interest earned and update the account balances accordingly. This system is user-friendly and provides an interactive way to manage basic banking operations.

## Features

- **Savings Account Management**: Users can input their savings account details, including balance, interest rate, and duration, to calculate the interest earned and update the balance.
- **CD Account Management**: Similar to savings, users can manage CD accounts by inputting relevant details to calculate interest earned over a specific period.
- **Interest Calculation**: The system accurately calculates interest based on the provided interest rates and durations for both savings and CD accounts.
- **Balance Update**: After interest calculation, the program automatically updates the account balances to reflect the earned interest.
- **User Interaction**: The program interacts with the user through prompts, making it easy to input and review account details.
